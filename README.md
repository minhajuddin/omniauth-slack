# OmniAuth::Slack

This Gem contains the Slack OAuth2 strategy for OmniAuth and supports most features of
the [Slack OAuth2 authorization API](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth), including the
[Sign in with Slack](https://api.slack.com/docs/sign-in-with-slack) and
[Add to Slack](https://api.slack.com/docs/slack-button) approval flows.

This Gem supports Slack "classic" apps and tokens as well as [Workspace apps and tokens](https://api.slack.com/workspace-apps-preview).


## Before You Begin

OmniAuth::Slack is implemented through OmniAuth modules and methods, so you should familiarize yourself with the basics of [OmniAuth (README)](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth).

OmniAuth::Slack authorizes Slack users on behalf of a defined Slack application. If you don't already have an application defined on Slack, sign into the [Slack application dashboard](https://api.slack.com/applications) and create an application. Take note of your API keys.

While you're in the application settings, add a Redirect URL to your application (under the `OAuth & Permissions` section), something simple like `http://localhost:3000/` or `https://myslackapp.com/`. The URL doesn't have to be accessible to the public internet, but it should be accessible to your development machine.


## Using This Strategy

First start by adding this gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ginjo-omniauth-slack', require: 'omniauth-slack'
```

Or specify the latest HEAD version from the ginjo repository:

```ruby
gem 'ginjo-omniauth-slack', git: 'https://github.com/ginjo/omniauth-slack', require: 'omniauth-slack'
```

Next, tell OmniAuth about this provider.

For a __[Rails](https://rubyonrails.org)__ app, your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` file should look like this:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :slack, 'API_KEY', 'API_SECRET', scope: 'string-of-scopes'
end
```

Replace `'API_KEY'` and `'API_SECRET'` with the appropriate values you obtained [earlier](https://api.slack.com/applications).
Replace `'string-of-scopes'` with a space-separated string of Slack API scopes.


For a __[Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com/)__ app:

```ruby
require 'sinatra'
require 'omniauth-slack'

use OmniAuth::Builder do |env|
  provider :slack,
    ENV['SLACK_OAUTH_KEY_WS'],
    ENV['SLACK_OAUTH_SECRET_WS'],
    scope: 'string-of-scopes'
end
```


If you are using __[Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)__ then it will look like this:

```ruby
Devise.setup do |config|
  # other stuff...

  config.omniauth :slack, ENV['SLACK_APP_ID'], ENV['SLACK_APP_SECRET'], scope: 'string-of-scopes'

  # other stuff...
end
```


To manually install and require the gem:
```bash
# shell
gem install ginjo-omniauth-slack
````

```ruby
# ruby
require 'omniauth-slack'
```


## Scopes
Slack lets you choose from a [number of different scopes](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-scopes).
*Here's another [table of Slack scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes) showing __classic__ and __workspace__ app compatibility.*

**Important:** You cannot request both `identity` scopes and regular scopes in a single authorization request.

If you need to combine "Add to Slack" scopes with those used for "Sign in with Slack", you should configure two providers:

```ruby
provider :slack, 'API_KEY', 'API_SECRET', scope: 'identity.basic', name: :sign_in_with_slack
provider :slack, 'API_KEY', 'API_SECRET', scope: 'team:read,users:read,identify,bot'
```

Use the first provider to sign users in and the second to add the application, and deeper capabilities, to their team.

Sign-in-with-Slack handles quick authorization of users with minimally scoped requests.
Deeper scope authorizations are acquired with further passes through the Add-to-Slack authorization process.

This works because Slack scopes are additive: Once you successfully authorize a scope, the token will possess that scope forever, regardless of what flow or scopes are requested at future authorizations (removal of scope requires revocation of the token or uninstallation of the Slack app from the team).

TODO:
See *further-info* for alternative techniques to handle multiple sets of scopes and progressive permissions.


## Authentication Options

TODO: Fix all references to 'above'.

Authentication options are specified in the provider block, as shown above, and all are optional except for `:scope`.
You will need to specify at least one scope to get a successful authentication and authorization.

TODO: Fix this reference to 'below'.
Some of these options can also be given at runtime in the authorization request url (See __pass\_through\_params__ below).

More information on provider and authentication options can be found in omniauth-slack's supporting gems [omniauth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth), [oauth2](https://github.com/oauth-xx/oauth2), and [omniauth-oauth2](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-oauth2).


### Scope
*required*

```ruby
  :scope => 'string-of-space-separated-scopes'
```

Specify the scopes you would like to request for the token during the authorization request.


### Team
*optional*

```ruby
  :team => 'team-id'
    # and/or
  :team_domain => 'team-subdomain'
```

> If you don't pass a team param, the user will be allowed to choose which team they are authenticating against. Passing this param ensures the user will auth against an account on that particular team.

If you need to ensure that the users use the team whose team_id is 'XXXXXXXX', you can do so by passing `:team` option in your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` like this:

```ruby
  Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
    provider :slack, 'API_KEY', 'API_SECRET', scope: 'identify,read,post', team: 'XXXXXXXX'
  end
```

If your user is not already signed in to the Slack team that you specify, they will be asked to provide the team domain first.

Another (possibly undocumented) way to specify team is by passing in the `:team_domain` parameter.
In contrast to setting `:team`, setting `:team_domain` will force authentication against the specified team (credentials permitting of course), even if the user is not signed in to that team.
However, if you are already signed in to that team, specifying the `:team_domain` alone will not let you skip the Slack authorization dialog, as is possible when you specify `:team`.

Sign in behavior with team settings and signed in state can be confusing. Here is a breakdown based on Slack documentation and observations while using this gem.


#### Team settings and sign in state vs Slack OAuth behavior. 

| Setting and state | Will authenticate against specific team | Will skip authorization approval<br>-<br>*The elusive unobtrusive<br>[Sign in with Slack](https://api.slack.com/docs/sign-in-with-slack)* |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| using `:team`, already signed in | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| using `:team`, not signed in |   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| using `:team_domain`, already signed in | :heavy_check_mark: |   |
| using `:team_domain`, not signed in | :heavy_check_mark: |   |
| using `:team` and `:team_domain`, already signed in | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| using `:team` and `:team_domain`, not signed in |   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| using no team parameters |   |   |

*Slack's authorization process will only skip the authorization approval step, if in addition to the above settings and state, ALL of the following conditions are met:*

* Token has at least one identity scope previously approved.
* Current authorization is requesting at least one identity scope.
* Current authorization is not requesting any scopes that the token does not already have.
* Current authorization is not requesting any non-identity scopes (but it's ok if the token already has non-identity scopes).


### Redirect URI
*optional*

```ruby
  :redirect_uri => 'https://<defaults-to-the-app-origin-host-and-port>/auth/slack/callback'
```

*This setting overrides the `:callback_path` setting.*

Set a custom redirect URI in your app, where Slack will redirect-to with an authorization code.
The redirect URI, whether default or custom, MUST match a registered redirect URI in [your app settings on api.slack.com](https://api.slack.com/apps).
See the [Slack OAuth docs](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth) for more details on Redirect URI registration and matching rules.


### Callback Path 
*optional*

```ruby
  :callback_path => '/auth/slack/callback'
```

*This setting is ignored if `:redirect_uri` is set.*

Set a custom callback path (path only, not the full URI) for Slack to redirect-to with an authorization code. This will be appended to the default redirect URI only. If you wish to specify a custom redirect URI with a custom callback path, just include both in the `:redirect_uri` setting.


### Skip Info 
*optional*

```ruby
  :skip_info => false
```

Skip building the `InfoHash` section of the `AuthHash` object.

If set, only a single api request will be made for each authorization. The response of that authorization request may or may not contain user and email data.


TODO: Clarify difference between the above filter and this list.
### Dependency List & Order
*optional*

```ruby
  :dependencies => %w(api_users_identity api_users_info api_team_info api_bots_info)
```

Lists the API methods to call, and in what order, upon successful authorization.
These methods will be used to build the `info` and `extra` section of the `auth_hash` object,
depending on what scopes have been awarded to the currently authorized token.

Leave this alone for the default order, which should give the best general experience in most situations.

The available API data calls are

    api_users_identity
    api_users_info
    api_users_profile
    api_team_info
    api_bots_info


### Preload Data with Threads
*optional*

```ruby
  :preload_data_with_threads => 0
```
*This option is ignored if `:skip_info => true` is set.*

With passed integer > 0, omniauth-slack preloads the basic identity-and-info API call responses, from Slack, using *<#integer>* pooled threads.

The default `0` skips this feature and only loads those API calls if required, scoped, and authorized, to build the AuthHash.

```ruby
  provider :slack, key, secret, :preload_data_with_threads => 2
```

More threads can potentially give a quicker callback phase.
The caveat is an increase in concurrent request load on Slack, possibly affecting rate limits.

A second parameter to this option is an array of API methods to call.
The possible methods are as listed above under the `:dependencies` section.
The default, if the integer > 0, is to preload all of the API methods (scope dependent, of course).

```ruby
  :preload_data_with_threads => [5, %w(api_users_info api_users_profile api_users_identity)]
```

Use this list in cooperation with the `:dependencies` option to fine-tune your `info` section, `extra` section,
and post-authorization API call behavior and order.


### Additional Data
*experimental*

This experimental feature allows additional API calls to be made during the omniauth-slack callback phase.
Provide a hash of `{<name>: <proc-that-receives-env>}`, and the result will be attached as a hash
under `additional_data` in the `extra` section of the `AuthHash`.

```ruby
provider :slack, key, secret,
  additional_data: {
    channels: proc{|env| env['omniauth.strategy'].access_token.get('/api/conversations.list').parsed['channels'] },
    resources: proc{|env| env['omniauth.strategy'].access_token.get('/api/apps.permissions.resources.list').parsed }
  }
```


### Pass Through Params
*optional*

Options for `scope`, `team`, `team_domain`, and `redirect_uri` can also be given at runtime via the query string of the omniauth-slack authorization endpoint URL `/auth/slack?team=...`. The `scope`, `team`, and `redirect_uri` query parameters will be passed directly through to Slack in the OAuth GET request:

```ruby
  https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=identity.basic,identity.email&team=team-id&redirect_uri=https://different.subdomain/different/callback/path
```

The `team_domain` query parameter will be inserted into the GET request as a subdomain `https://team-domain.slack.com/oauth/authorize`.

__NOTE:__ Allowing `redirect_uri`, `scope`, or `team_domian` to be passed to Slack from your application's public API (`https://myapp.com/auth/slack?scope=...`) is a potential security risk. As of omniauth-slack version 2.5.0, the default is to NOT allow `scope`, `redirect_uri`, or `team_domain` pass-through options at runtime, *unless* they are listed in the `:pass_through_params` option. `team` (team_id) is still allowed to pass-through as a default.

To block all pass-through options.

```ruby
  provider :slack, KEY, SECRET, pass_through_params:nil
```
    
To allow all pass-through options.

```ruby
  provider :slack, KEY, SECRET, pass_through_params: %w(team scope redirect_uri team_domain)
```


## Slack Workspace Apps
This gem provides support for Slack [Workspace apps](https://api.slack.com/workspace-apps-preview). There are some important differences between Slack's classic apps and the new Workspace apps. The main points to be aware of when using omniauth-slack with Workspace Apps are:

* Workspace app tokens are issued as a single token per team. There are no user or bot tokens. All Workspace app API calls are made with the Workspace token. Calls that act on behalf of a user or bot are made with the same token.

* The available api calls and the scopes required to access them are different in Workspace apps. See Slack's docs on [Scopes](https://api.slack.com/scopes) and [Methods](https://api.slack.com/methods/workspace-tokens) for more details.


* The OmniAuth::AuthHash.credentials.scope object, returned from a successful authentication, is a hash with each value containing an array of scopes. (TODO: Fix this reference to 'below') See below for an example.


## Access Tokens

While Slack's access token is a simple string, the OAuth2 gem packages it along with any other data returned from the `/api/oauth.access` call, as an AccessToken instance. The `OAuth2::AccessToken` instance is a useful and often overlooked tool in the OAuth2 gem. With a valid AccessToken instance (generated from every successful OAuth2 cycle), you have the full spectrum of Slack API functionality at your fingertips.

The AccessToken contains everything you need to make Slack API requests: The actual token string, the expiration data, the team, user, scope, and an OAuth2::Client instance with the API key and secret.

The AccessToken generated by omniauth-slack also has additional features, such as `has_scope?(list-of-scopes)`, which queries the token's awarded scopes. This is handy for Slack Workspace apps and their multi-dimensional scopes.

#### Storage
Use the `AccessToken#to_hash` method to prepare the token for serialization and storage in a database. This method strips off all unnecessary objects and leaves just the data.

#### Retrieval
When you want to reconstitute the access-token from a stored hash or string, use the `OAuth2::AccessToken.from_hash` method. Or use omniauth-slack's convenience method:

`access_token = OmniAuth::Slack.build_access_token(key, secret, access_token_string_or_hash)`

#### Usage

Once you have a valid AccessToken instance, you can do things like

  ```ruby
    access_token.get('/api/apps.permissions.users.list')

    access_token.refresh

    access_token.post('/api/chat.postMessage', params: {channel: channel_id, text: message})
  ```
    
To extract data from the API response, call `parsed` on the response object.

  ```ruby
    access_token.get('/api/channels.list').parsed['channels']

    # => [{'id' => 1, 'name' => ...}, {'id' => ...}]
  ```


## The Auth Hash
TODO: Give a quick bit about what an auth_hash object is.

The AuthHash from this gem has the standard components of an `OmniAuth::AuthHash` object, with some additional data added to the `:info` and `:extra` sections.

If the scopes allow, additional api calls *may* be made to gather additional user and team info, unless the `:skip_info => true` is set.

The `:extra` section contains the parsed data from each of the api calls made during the authorization.
Also included is a `:raw_info` hash, which contains the raw response object from each of the api calls.

The `:extra` section also contains `:scopes_requested`, which are the scopes requested during the current authorization.

TODO: Update this gist. It is obsolete.
See [this gist for an example AuthHash](https://gist.github.com/ginjo/3105cf4e975996c9032bb4725f949cd2) from a workspace token with a mix of identity scopes and regular app scopes applied.

See <https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Auth-Hash-Schema> for more info on the auth_hash schema.


## The OAuth2 Cycle

The OAuth2 cycle is a three-way dance between the user's browser, the OAuth2 provider (Slack API), and the application server (your Slack App). It should work this way for any OAuth2 provider, including Slack.

1. The user/browser makes a request to `https://slack.com/oauth/authorize`, passing the application's client-id, requested-scopes, and optionally state, team-id, and redirect-uri. Slack then runs the user through the authorization dialogs.

2. Upon successful authorization, Slack redirects the browser to the application's callback url (or redirect_uri in Slack's terms) with a short-lived authorization code, for example:

   `https://yourapp.com/auth/slack/callback?code=ABCDE87364`
   
3. Omniauth-slack intercepts this request and exchanges the code, via Slack API, for a valid access-token.
   
And that's it. Control is then given to your application's `/auth/slack/callback` action.

The next step would be the application storing the access-token, maybe making additional API requests, and then rendering a page to the browser or redirecting to another action. In a working app, a session would store a reference to the token, and the token would be stored in a database. Then for every request from that user, a valid access-token would be accessible and usable to make further API requests.


## The OAuth2 Cycle with OmniAuth::Slack

While the browser experience may appear simple, there's quite a lot happening behind the scenes. Omiauth-slack is running as part of the Rack stack, behind your main app, and it handles most of the above sequence before your application even receives the requests.

So lets run through the cycle again and take a closer look.

0.
    1.  The user/browser makes a request to your application at `https://yourapp.com/auth/slack`. This URI could be the href of your signin-with-slack or add-to-slack button.
      
        Your application's server-side code doesn't need to know about this endpoint, and it doesn't need to define an action for it. Omniauth-slack middleware recognizes this URI as the authorization request.
        
    2.  Omniauth-slack intercepts this request, considers your configuration, stores some data in a session variable, and then redirects the browser, with the necessary data embedded in the URI params, to Slack.
    
        OmniAuth calls this the __request phase__, and your application sees none of it.
   
1.
    1. Having been redirected by omniauth-slack, the browser makes an authorization request to `https://slack.com/oauth/authorize`, passing the application's client-id, requested-scopes, and optionally state, team-id, and redirect-uri. This request contains everything Slack needs to authenticate the user and authorize access to Slack's API functions and data.

    2. Slack leads the user through any dialogs necessary to complete the authorization.
    
       Depending on the setup, the requested (and awarded) scopes and permissions, and Slack's internal logic, this cycle could appear as a series of dialogs or as a simple request/response. If identity scopes were requested (signin-with-slack flow), and a team-id was passed in the params, *and* the given scopes were previously authorized, Slack may grant authorization without requiring the user to click on any dialogs at all.
       
       Meanwhile, the application server and omniauth-slack are patiently waiting and have no idea what Slack, or the user, are doing at this point.

2. Upon successful authorization, Slack redirects the browser to the application's callback url (or redirect_uri in Slack's terms) with a short-lived authorization code, for example:

   `https://yourapp.com/auth/slack/callback?code=ABCDE87364`.
   
   Your application needs to define an endpoint (a route, an action, a method, etc.) for `/auth/slack/callback`, but omniauth-slack does all of its work before your app even sees the request.
   
3.  1. Omniauth-slack intercepts this request, and exchanges the authorization code for a valid access-token by making an API request to `https://slack.com/api/oauth.access`.

       The `oauth.access` response contains an access-token (and possibly other data) which omniauth-slack stores in the Rack `env` for later use by your application.
   
       OmniAuth refers to this part of the process as the __callback phase__, and you don't see any of it (Rack middleware magic).

    2. Rack then passes this callback request to your app, and you are at the logical beginning of whatever action you defined for `/auth/slack/callback`.
    
       There is a lot of data available in the request `env['omniauth.auth']` and `env['omniauth.strategy']`. There are also other env variables defined by omniauth and omniauth-slack. See the gem docs for more about those.
   

       At this point, you will likely want to grab the `env['omniauth.auth']` hash and the `env['omniauth.strategy'].access_token` object. Use the access-token to make further API requests, or store the token and auth_hash for later retrieval.
       
       TODO: Fix this reference to 'below'.
       See the note about access tokens below.
       

## OmniAuth::Slack Basic Examples

TODO: Clean this sentence up, or fix the reference to 'below'.
The above cycle could be implemented in Sinatra or Rails as simply as described below, but first...

#### Slack Settings
TODO: Is this section repetitive of the basic setup above?
 
Before you try to implement omniauth-slack, create a Slack app on api.slack.com. Then setup the app's Redirect URL list in your Slack App's `OAuth & Permissions` section on api.slack.com. Set one or more Redirect URL entries that match the domain:port of this simple application. The app doesn't have to be accessible from the public internet, just from your local machine, for example: `http://localhost:9292` or `http://192.168.0.5:8000`.

### Sinatra Example

Create a Sinatra project directory, then add these files.

#### simple_app.rb

  ```ruby
    require 'omniauth-slack'
    require 'sinatra'
    require 'yaml'

    enable :sessions
  
    # optional
    #set :port, '9292'
    #set :bind, '0.0.0.0'

    use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :slack, SLACK_OAUTH_KEY, SLACK_OAUTH_SECRET, scope:'identity:read:user'
    end

    get '/auth/slack/callback' do
      content_type 'text/yaml'
      { auth_hash:    env['omniauth.auth'],
        access_token: env['omniauth.strategy'].access_token
      }.to_yaml
    end
```
#### Gemfile

  ```ruby
    source 'https://rubygems.org'
    gem 'ginjo-omniauth-slack', require: 'omniauth-slack'   #, git:'https://github.com/ginjo/omniauth-slack'
    gem 'sinatra'
    gem 'puma'
  ```

Put those in their respective files, fill in your Slack OAuth2 credentials, then launch.

    bundle install
    bundle exec ruby super_simple.rb

Then point your browser to

    http://<host-and-port-recognized-in-slack-redirect-uri-list>/auth/slack

When a successful authorization cycle completes, your browser should end up with a yaml representation of the auth_hash and access_token objects. What happens next is entirely up to your application.

### Rails Example

Create a rails project, then add or modify these files. Note that this is not necessarily the best way to do this in a production system. It's just a demonstration of the bare necessities to get omniauth-slack working in Rails.

#### config/initializers/middleware.rb
    
  ```ruby
    require 'omniauth-slack'

    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
      provider :slack, SLACK_OAUTH_KEY, SLACK_OAUTH_SECRET, scope:'identity:read:user'
    end
  ```   
#### app/controllers/auth_controller.rb
    
  ```ruby
    class AuthController < ApplicationController
      def callback
        render plain: { access_token: request.env['omniauth.strategy'].access_token.to_hash,
          auth_hash:  request.env['omniauth.auth']
        }.to_yaml
      end
    end
  ```
#### config/routes.rb

  ```ruby
    get 'auth/slack/callback', to: 'auth#callback'
  ```
#### Gemfile

  ```ruby
    gem 'ginjo-omniauth-slack', require: 'omniauth-slack'   #, git:'https://github.com/ginjo/omniauth-slack'
  ```
Don't forget to fill in your Slack API credentials. Then start up Rails, and point your browser to

    http://<host-and-port-recognized-in-slack-redirect-uri-list>/auth/slack
    
When a successful authorization cycle completes, your browser should end up with a yaml representation of the auth_hash and access_token objects. What happens next is entirely up to your application.
